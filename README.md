# Heart_Disease_Prediction_using_ANN
This project demonstrates how to build a Deep Learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).  The model learns patterns in medical data to classify whether a person has heart disease based on clinical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, etc.
